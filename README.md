🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an advanced Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system using Python to provide non-contact, full-field displacement and strain measurements. The primary application is focused on Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), specifically the accurate and early detection of micro-crack initiation and propagation in critical aircraft structural components.

The system processes high-resolution image sequences taken before and during mechanical loading to identify subtle surface deformations, providing crucial data for preventive maintenance and structural integrity assessment.

✨ Key Features

High-Precision Defect Detection: Achieves high precision in identifying micro-cracks and material defects at the early stages of initiation, supporting proactive maintenance strategies.

SSIM-Based Correlation: Utilizes the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) alongside traditional correlation techniques to enhance the robustness and accuracy of local deformation measurements, especially in areas with subtle texture changes.

Image Preprocessing Pipeline: Implements a series of robust image preprocessing techniques (e.g., filtering, histogram equalization) using OpenCV to optimize image quality and improve the reliability of defect detection in real-world conditions.

Real-Time Data Visualization: Designed a user-friendly, web-based interface using Flask for interactive data upload, processing control, and real-time display of deformation maps and crack detection results (rendered via Matplotlib).

Performance Validation: Rigorously validated the system's robustness and reliability through extensive testing against multiple test cases and real-world image sets from material fatigue experiments.
